Process-in-Process (PiP) Implementation

* Execution mode

  There are three PiP implementations and environmant variable setting;

  1) PiP using pthread_create only
     "PIP_MODE=thread"
     In this mode, a PiP task behaves more like a pthread, having no
     PID.

  2) otherwise,
     "PIP_MODE=process"
     In this mode, a PiP task behaves more like a process, having PID.

  2-1) PiP using pthread_create and cloone warpper
     "PIP_MODE=process:preload, LD_PRELOAD=<PIP_INSTALL_DIR>/lib"

  2-2) PiP not using pthread_clone at all [experimantal, yet]
     "PIP_MODE=process:pipclone"

* Synchronization between PiP tasks

  Currently, ptherad_barrier and pthread_mutex works between PiP root
  process and PiP tasks. However, this does NOT mean there pthread
  synchronization are guaranteed to work as part of the PiP
  specification.

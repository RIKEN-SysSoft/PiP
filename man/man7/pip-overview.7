the PiP library 


.SH "Overview"
.PP
PiP is a user-level library which allows a process to create sub-processes into the same virtual address space where the parent process runs\&. The parent process and sub-processes share the same address space, however, each process has its own static variables\&. So, each process runs independently from the other process\&. If some or all processes agreed, then data own by a process can be accessed by the other processes\&.
.PP
Those processes share the same address space, just like pthreads, but each process has its own variables like processes\&. The parent process is called \fIPiP\fP \fIprocess\fP and sub-processes are called \fIPiP\fP \fItask\fP since it has the best of the both worlds of processes and pthreads\&.
.PP
PiP root can spawn one or more number of PiP tasks\&. The executable of the PiP task must be compiled (with the '-fpie' or '-pic' compile option) and linked (with the '-pie' linker option) to be a PIE (Position Independent Executable)\&.
.PP
When a PiP root or PiP task is willing to be accessed the its own data by the other(s), firstly a memory region where the data to be accessed are located must be \fIexported\fP\&. Then the exported memory region is \fIimported\fP so that the exported and imported data can be accessed\&. The PiP library supports the functions to export and import the pointers to memory regions\&.
.PP
Unlike shared memory techniques (shared mmap, POSIX-shmem, SYSV-shmem, and XPMEM), PiP allows PiP root and PiP tasks share the entire virtual address space fromm the beginning\&. So, any pointers can be dereferenced as they are\&. Additionally there is no need to cast a spell to share a memory region\&. All users have to do is passing pointers\&.
.SH "Thread"
.PP
.SS "Thread"
PiP also provides new thread implementation named 'Bi-Level Thread
(BLT)', again, to take the best of two worlds, Kernel-Level Thread (KLT) and User-Level Thread (ULT) here\&. A BLT is a PiP task\&. When a PiP task is created it runs as a KLT\&. At any point the KLT can becomme a ULT by decoupling the associated kernel thread from the KLT\&. The decoupled kernel thread becommes idle\&. Later, the ULT can become KLT again by coupling with the kernel thread\&.
.SS "Process"
As described, PiP allows PiP tasks to share the same virtual address space\&. This mans that a PiP task can context-switch to the other PiP task at user-level\&. This is called User-Level Process where processes may be derived from the same program or different programs\&. Threads basically share most of the kernel resources, such as address space, file descriptors, a process id, and so on whilst processes do not\&. Every process has its ows file descriptor space, for example\&. When a ULP is scheduled by a KLT having PID 1000, then the \fBgetpid()\fP \fBis\fP called by the ULP returns 1000\&. Further, when the ULT is migrated to be scheduled by the other KLT, then the returned PID is different\&. So, when implemnting a ULP system, this systemcall consistency must be preserved\&. In ULP on PiP, the consistency can be maintained by utilizing the above BLT mechanism\&. When a ULT tries to call a system call, it is coupled with its kernel thread which was created at the beginning as a KLT\&.
.SH "Execution mode"
.PP
There are several PiP implementation modes which can be selected at the runtime\&. These implementations can be categorized into two according to the behavior of PiP tasks,
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCPthread\fP, and
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCProcess\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
In the pthread mode, although each PiP task has its own variables unlike thread, PiP task behaves more like Pthread, having a TID, having the same file descriptor space, having the same signal delivery semantics as Pthread does, and so on\&. In the process mode, PiP task behaves more like a process, having a PID, having an independent file descriptor space, having the same signal delivery semantics as Linux process does, and so on\&. The above mentioned ULP can only work with the process mode\&.
.PP
When the \fCPIP_MODE\fP environment variable set to "thread" then the PiP library runs based on the pthread mode, and it is set to "process" then it runs with the process mode\&. There are also two implementations in the \fBprocess\fP mode; "process:preload" and "process:pipclone" The former one must be with the \fBLD_PRELOAD\fP environment variable setting so that the \fBclone()\fP system call wrapper can work with\&. The latter one can only be specified with the PIP-patched glibc library (see below: \fBGLIBC\fP issues)\&.
.PP
There several function provided by the PiP library to absorb the difference due to the execution mode
.SH "Limitation"
.PP
PiP allows PiP root and PiP tasks to share the data, so the function pointer can be passed to the others\&. However, jumping into the code owned by the other may not work properly for some reasons\&.
.SH "Compile and Link User programs"
.PP
The PiP root ust be linked with the PiP library and libpthread\&. The programs able to run as a PiP task must be compiled with the "-fpie" compile option and the "-pie -rdynamic" linker options\&.
.SH "GLIBC issues"
.PP
The PiP library is implemented at the user-level, i\&.e\&. no need of kernel patches nor kernel modules\&. Due to the novel usage of combining \fCdlmopn()\fP GLIBC function and \fCclone()\fP systemcall, there are some issues found in the GLIBC\&. To avoid this issues, PiP users are recommenmded to have the patched GLIBC provided by the PiP development team\&.
.SH "PiP-GDB"
.PP
The normal gdb debugger only works with the PiP root\&. PiP-aware GDB (PiP-gdb) is also provided and must be used for debugging PiP tasks\&. In PiP-gdb, PiP tasks and root can be debugged as GDB inferiors\&. The current PiP-gdb does not work with the PiP's thread execution mode\&.
.SH "Debug on Exception Signals"
.PP
If the PIP_GDB_PATH environment is set to the path to PiP-gdb, then PiP-gdb is automatically attached when an excetion signal (SIGSEGV and SIGHUP by default) is delivered\&. The exception signals can also be defined by setting the PIP_GDB_SIGNALS environment\&. Signal names can be concatenated by the '+' or '-' symbol\&. 'all' is reserved to specify most of the signals\&. For example, 'ALL-TERM' means all signals excepting SIGTERM, another example, 'PIPE+INT' means SIGPIPE and SIGINT\&. If one of the defined or default signals is delivered, then PiP-gdb will be attached\&. The PiP-gdb will show backtrace by default\&. If users specify PIP_GDB_COMMAND that contains GDB commands, then those GDB commands will be executed by the GDB in batch mode\&.

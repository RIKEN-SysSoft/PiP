Process-in-Process (PiP) Installation

* Overview and GLIBC issue
  PiP is a library to create processes in a process's virtual address
  space implemented at user-level. Unfortunately the current GLIBC,
  specifically libpthreads.so, has a problem and PiP is unable to
  create sub-processes. To fix this issue, you have to install our
  patched GLIBC before building the PiP library.

* Patched GLIBC
  You can download the pacthed GLIBC from the following URL.

	git clone -b pip-centos7 \
	     	git@git.sys.aics.riken.jp:software/PIP-glibc

  Here is the recommended configure options for the patched GLIBC
  based on CentOS 7.2,

	configure --prefix=$2 CC=gcc CXX=g++ 'CFLAGS=-mtune=generic \
		-fasynchronous-unwind-tables -DNDEBUG -g -O3 \
		-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables' \
		--enable-add-ons=ports,nptl,rtkaio,c_stubs,libidn \
		--with-headers=/usr/include --enable-kernel=2.6.32 \
		--enable-bind-now --build=x86_64-redhat-linux \
		--enable-multi-arch --enable-obsolete-rpc \
		--disable-profile --enable-nss-crypt --disable-systemtap

* Building PiP
  At the PiP confiuration, you must specify the installed GLIBC.

	git clone git@git.sys.aics.riken.jp:software/PIP
ã€€	configure --prefix=<PREFIXDIR> --with-glibc-libdir-<GLIBC_INSTALL_DIR>

  After the successful PiP installation, you must do the following,

  	<PIP_INSTALL_DIR>/bin/piplnlibs

  This command creates a number of symbolic links to the SOLIBs which
  are not installed by the patched GLIBC installation.

* Test programs
  A number of test programs can be found in thePIP/test directory.

* To compile, link, and run your PiP programs
  - PiP root process (spawning PiP tasks)
    must be linked with the PiP library and must specify the link
    option as follows,

    	   --dynamic-linker=<GLIBC-LDLINUX>

    here, <GLIBC-LDLINUX> is the path of ld-linux.so of the patched
    GLIBC, looks like "ld-2.17.so". Once you specify this option,
    PiP root process uses the pathed GLIBC, no matter how
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH is specified. Remember that the other SOLIBs are
    already copied (indeed, symbolic links) into that directory by the
    "piplnlibs" command (see above).
    The PiP root process is not required to be PIE.

  - PiP task (spawned by PiP root process)
    must be compiled with "-pie", must be linked with "-fpie
    -rdynamic" options. PiP task programs are not required to be
    linked with the PiP libarary. Thus programs to be ran as PiP tasks
    are not required to modify their cource code. Since PiP root and
    PiP task(s) share the same (virtual0 address space and ld-linux.so
    is already loaded by PiP root, PiP tasks use the patched GLIBC.

  - Run PiP root program
    The LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment must includes the PiP library.
    Consult IMPLEMENTATION file located at the same directory of this
    file for details.

  - How to check if PiP programs run under PiP environment
    check if they are shared the same address space by the following
    command,

	cat /proc/<PID>/maps

    Here, <PID> is the pid of the root process or one of the PiP
    tasks.

* MPI with PiP
  Currently, we are working with ANL to develop MPICH using PiP. This
  repository, located at ANL, is not yet open to public at the time of
  writing.


  Enjoy !

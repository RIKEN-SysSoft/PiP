# Process-in-Process (PiP)

PiP is a user-level library to have the best of the both worlds
of multi-process and multi-thread parallel execution models. PiP
allows a process to create sub-processes into the same virtual address
space where the parent process runs. The parent process and
sub-processes share the same address space, however, each process has
its own variable set. So, each process runs independently from the
other process. If some or all processes agree, then data owned by a
process can be accessed by the other processes. Those processes share
the same address space, just like pthreads, but each process has its
own variables like the process execution model. Hereinafter, the
parent process is called PiP process and sub-processes are called 
PiP tasks.

## PiP Versions

Currently there are three PiP library versions:

* Version 1 - Deprecated
* Version 2 - Stable version
* Version 3 - Stable version supporting BLT and ULP (experimental)

Unfortunately each version has unique ABI and there is no ABI
compatibility among them. The functionality of PiP-v1 is almost the
same with PiP-v2, however, PiP-v2's API is a subset of the PiP-v3's
API. Hereafter **NN** denotes the PiP version number.

## Bi-Level Thread (BLT, from v3)

PiP also provides new thread implementation named "Bi-Level Thread
(BLT)", again, to take the best of two worlds, Kernel-Level Thread
(KLT) and User-Level Thread (ULT) here. A BLT is a PiP task. When a
PiP task is created it runs as a KLT. At any point the KLT can
becomme a ULT by decoupling the associated kernel thread from the
KLT. The decoupled kernel thread becommes idle. Later, the ULT can
become KLT again by coupling with the kernel thread.

## User-Level Process (ULP, from v3)

As described, PiP allows PiP tasks to share the same virtual
address space. This mans that a PiP task can context-switch to the
other PiP task at user-level. This is called User-Level Process
where processes may be derived from the same program or different
programs. Threads basically share most of the kernel resources,
such as address space, file descriptors, a process id, and so
on whilst processes do not. Every process has its ows file
descriptor space, for example. When a ULP is scheduled by a KLT
having PID 1000, then the getpid() is called by the ULP
returns 1000. Further, when the ULT is migrated to be scheduled by
the other KLT, then the returned PID is different. So, when
implemnting a ULP system, this systemcall consistency must be
preserved. In ULP on PiP, the consistency can be
maintained by utilizing the above BLT mechanism. When a ULT tries
to call a system call, it is coupled with its kernel thread which
was created at the beginning as a KLT. It should be note that Thread
Local Storage (TLS) regions are also switched when switching ULP (and
BLT) contexts.

## Execution Mode

There are several PiP implementation modes which can be selected at
the runtime. These implementations can be categorized into two;

- Process and
- (P)Thread.

In the pthread mode, although each PiP task has its own static
variables unlike thread, PiP task behaves more like PThread, having a TID,
having the same file descriptor space, having the same signal
delivery semantics as Pthread does, and so on.
In the process mode, a PiP task behaves more like a process, having
a PID, having an independent file descriptor space, having the same
signal delivery semantics as Linux process does, and so on. The
above mentioned ULP can only work with the process mode.

When the **PIP\_MODE** environment variable set to "()thread"
then
the PiP library runs in the pthread mode, and if it is set to
"process" then it runs in the process mode. There are also three
implementations in the process mode; "process:preload,"
"process:pipclone" and "process:got." The "process:preload" mode
must be with the **LD\_PRELOAD** environment variable setting so that
the clone() system call wrapper can work with. The
"process:pipclone" mode is only effective with the PIP-patched
glibc library (see below).

Several function are made available by the PiP library to absorb the
functional differences due to the execution modes.

see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

# Installation

Basically PiP requires the following three software packages;

* [PiP](https://github.com/RIKEN-SysSoft/PiP) - Process in Process (this package)
* [PiP-Testsuite](https://github.com/RIKEN-SysSoft/PiP-Testsuite) - Testsuite for PiP
* [PiP-glibc](https://github.com/RIKEN-SysSoft/PiP-glibc) - patched GNU libc for PiP
* [PiP-gdb](https://github.com/RIKEN-SysSoft/PiP-gdb) - patched gdb to debug PiP root and PiP tasks.

By using PiP-glibc, users can create up to 300 PiP tasks which can be
dbugged by using PiP-gdb.  In other words, without installing
PiP-glibc, users can create up to around 10 PiP tasks (the number
depends on the program) and cannot debug by using PiP-gdb.  Note that
PiP will not run at all without PiP-glibc on CentOS/RedHat 8.

There are several ways to install the PiP packages; Yum (RPM), Docker,
Spack, and building from the source code. It is strongly recommended
to use the following PiP package installation program (pip-pip):

* [PiP-pip](https://github.com/RIKEN-SysSoft/PiP-pip) - PiP package
  installing program

This is the easiest way to install PiP packages in any form. Here is
the example of `pip-pip` usage:

    $ git clone https://github.com/RIKEN-SysSoft/PiP-pip.git
    $ cd PiP-pip
    $ ./pip-pip --how=HOW --pip=PIP_VERSION --work=BUILD_DIR --prefix=INSTALL_DIR

**HOW** can be one of `yum`, `docker`, `spack` and `github`, or any
  combination of them. `pip-pip --help` will show you how to use the
  program. `yum`, `docker` and `spack` include all three packages;
  PiP-glibc, PiP-lib, and PiP-gdb.

# PiP Documents

The following PiP documents are created by using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

## Man pages

Man pages will be installed at **PIP\_INSTALL\_DIR**/share/man.

    $ man -M PIP_INSTALL_DIR/share/man 7 libpip

Or, use the pip-man command (from v2).

    $ PIP_INSTALL_DIR/bin/pip-man 7 libpip

The above two exammples will show you the same document you are reading.

## PDF

[PDF documents](doc/latex-inuse/libpip-manpages.pdf) will be installed at
**PIP\_INSTALL\_DIR**/share/pdf.

## HTML

[HTML documents](doc/html/index.html) will be installed at
**PIP\_INSTALL\_DIR**/share/html.

# Getting Started

## Compile and link your PiP programs

* pipcc(1) command (since v2)

You can use pipcc(1) command to compile and link your PiP programs.

    $ pipcc -Wall -O2 -g -c pip-prog.c
    $ pipcc -Wall -O2 -g pip-prog.c -o pip-prog 

## Run your PiP programs

* pip-exec(1) command (piprun(1) in PiP v1)

Let's assume that you have a non-PiP program(s) and wnat to run as PiP
tasks. All you have to do is to compile your program by using the above
pipcc(1) command and to use the pip-exec(1) command to run your program
as PiP tasks.

    $ pipcc myprog.c -o myprog
    $ pip-exec -n 8 ./myprog
    $ ./myprog

In this case, the pip-exec(1) command becomes the PiP root and your program
runs as 8 PiP tasks. Note that the 'myprog.c' may or may not call any
PiP functions. Your program can also run as a normal program (not as a
PiP task) without using the pip-exec(1) command. In either case, your
proghrams must be compiled and linked by using the pipcc(1) command
described above.

You may write your own PiP programs whcih includes the PiP root programming.
In this case, your program can run without using the pip-exec(1) command.

If you get the following message when you try to run your program;

    PiP-ERR(19673) './myprog' is not PIE

Then this means that the 'myprog' (having PID 19673) is not compiled
by using the pipcc(1) command properly. You may check if your
program(s) can run as a PiP root and/or PiP task by using the
pip-check(1) command (from v2);

    $ pip-check a.out
    a.out : Root&Task

Above example shows that the 'a.out' program can run as a PiP root and PiP tasks.

* pips(1) command (from v2)

  Similar to the Linux `ps` command, you can see how your PiP program(s)
  is (are) running by using the `pips(1)` command. `pips` can accept
  'a', 'u' and 'x' options just like the `ps` command.

    $ pips [a][u][x] [PIPS-OPTIONS] [-] [PATTERN ..]

  List the PiP tasks via the 'ps' command;

    $ pips --ps [ PATTERN .. ]

  or, show the activities of PiP tasks via the 'top' command;

    $ pips --top [ PATTERN .. ]

  Additionally you can kill all of your PiP tasks by using the same pips(1) command;

    $ pips -s KILL [ PATTERN .. ]

## Debugging your PiP programs by the pip-gdb command

The following procedure attaches all PiP tasks and PiP root which
created those tasks. Each PiP task is treated as a GDB inferior
in PiP-gdb. Note that PiP-glibc and PiP-gdb packages are required to
do this.

    $ pip-gdb
    (pip-gdb) attach PID

The attached inferiors can be seen by the following GDB command:

    (pip-gdb) info inferiors
      Num  Description              Executable
      4    process 6453 (pip 2)     /somewhere/pip-task-2
      3    process 6452 (pip 1)     /somewhere/pip-task-1
      2    process 6451 (pip 0)     /somewhere/pip-task-0
    * 1    process 6450 (pip root)  /somewhere/pip-root

You can select and debug an inferior by the following GDB command:

    (pip-gdb) inferior 2
    [Switching to inferior 2 [process 6451 (pip 0)] (/somewhere/pip-task-0)]

When an already-attached program calls 'pip_spawn()' and becomes
a PiP root task, the newly created PiP child tasks aren't attached
automatically, but you can add empty inferiors and then attach
the PiP child tasks to the inferiors.
e.g.

    .... type Control-Z to stop the root task.
    ^Z
    Program received signal SIGTSTP, Stopped (user).

    (pip-gdb) add-inferior
    Added inferior 2
    (pip-gdb) inferior 2
    (pip-gdb) attach 1902

    (pip-gdb) add-inferior
    Added inferior 3
    (pip-gdb) inferior 3
    (pip-gdb) attach 1903

    (pip-gdb) add-inferior
    Added inferior 4
    (pip-gdb) inferior 4
    (pip-gdb) attach 1904

    (pip-gdb) info inferiors
      Num  Description              Executable
    * 4    process 1904 (pip 2)     /somewhere/pip-task-2
      3    process 1903 (pip 1)     /somewhere/pip-task-1
      2    process 1902 (pip 0)     /somewhere/pip-task-0
      1    process 1897 (pip root)  /somewhere/pip-root

You can attach all relevant PiP tasks by:

    $ pip-gdb -p PID-of-your-PiP-program

(from v2)

If the **PIP\_GDB\_PATH** environment is set to the path pointing to PiP-gdb
executable file, then PiP-gdb is automatically attached when an
excetion signal (SIGSEGV and SIGHUP by default) is delivered. The
exception signals can also be defined by
setting the **PIP\_GDB\_SIGNALS** environment. Signal names (case
insensitive) can be
concatenated by the '+' or '-' symbol. 'all' is reserved to specify most
of the signals. For example, 'ALL-TERM' means all signals excepting
SIGTERM, another example, 'PIPE+INT' means SIGPIPE and SIGINT. If
one of the specified or default signals is delivered, then PiP-gdb will be
attached automatically. The PiP-gdb will show backtrace by default. If users
specify **PIP\_GDB\_COMMAND**, a filename containing some GDB
commands, then those GDB commands will be executed by PiP-gdb in batch
mode. If the **PIP\_STOP\_ON\_START** environment is 
set, then the PiP library delivers SIGSTOP to a spawned
PiP task which is about to start user program. If its value is a
number in decimal, then the PiP task whose PiP-ID is the same with the
specified number will be stopped.  If the number is minus, then all
PiP tasks will be stopped at the very beginning. Do not forget to
compile your programs with a debug option.

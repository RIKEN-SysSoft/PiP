                 Gene Linux and discuss the design and implementation of
                 'Big Memory'——an alternative, transparent memory
                 space introduced to eliminate the memory performance
                 issues. We evaluate the performance of Big Memory using
                 custom memory benchmarks, NAS Parallel Benchmarks, and
                 the Parallel Ocean Program, at a scale of up to 4,096
                 nodes. We find that Big Memory successfully resolves
                 the performance issues normally encountered in Blue
                 Gene Linux. For the ocean simulation program, we even
                 find that Linux with Big Memory provides better
                 scalability than does the lightweight compute node
                 kernel designed solely for high-performance
                 applications. Originally intended exclusively for
                 compute node tasks, our new memory subsystem
                 dramatically improves the performance of certain I/O
                 node applications as well. We demonstrate this
                 performance using the central processor of the LOw
                 Frequency ARray radio telescope as an example.",

  abstract =     "In 2008, the Catamount lightweight kernel was extended
                 to support direct access shared memory between
                 processes running on the same compute node. This
                 extension, called SMARTMAP, allows each process
                 read/write access to another process' memory by
                 extending the virtual address of each process. Simple
                 virtual address bit manipulation can be used to access
                 the same virtual address in a different process'
                 address space. In this paper we describe an
                 implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
                 that uses SMARTMAP for intra-node message passing.
                 SMARTMAP has several advantages over POSIX shared
                 memory techniques for implementing MPI. We present
                 performance results comparing MPI using SMARTMAP to the
                 existing MPI transport layer on a quad-core Cray XT
                 platform.",

  abstract =     "<p>Resilience is a major roadblock for HPC executions
                 on future exascale systems. These systems will
                 typically gather millions of CPU cores running up to a
                 billion threads. Projections from current large systems
                 and technology evolution predict errors will happen in
                 exascale systems many times per day. These errors will
                 propagate and generate various kinds of malfunctions,
                 from simple process crashes to result corruptions.<br
                 /> The past five years have seen extraordinary
                 technical progress in many domains related to exascale
                 resilience. Several technical options, initially
                 considered inapplicable or unrealistic in the HPC
                 context, have demonstrated surprising successes.
                 Despite this progress, the exascale resilience problem
                 is not solved, and the community is still facing the
                 difficult challenge of ensuring that exascale
                 applications complete and generate correct results
                 while running on unstable systems. Since 2009, many
                 workshops, studies, and reports have improved the
                 definition of the resilience problem and provided
                 refined recommendations. Some projections made during
                 the previous decades and some priorities established
                 from these projections need to be revised. This paper
                 surveys what the community has learned in the past five
                 years and summarizes the research problems still
                 considered critical by the HPC community.<br />

  abstract =     "As supercomputers are entering an era of massive
                 parallelism where the frequency of faults is
                 increasing, the MPI Standard remains distressingly
                 vague on the consequence of failures on MPI
                 communications. Advanced fault-tolerance techniques
                 have the potential to prevent full-scale application
                 restart and therefore lower the cost incurred for each
                 failure, but they demand from MPI the capability to
                 detect failures and resume communications afterward. In
                 this paper, we present a set of extensions to MPI that
                 allow communication capabilities to be restored, while
                 maintaining the extreme level of performance to which
                 MPI users have become accustomed. The motivation behind
                 the design choices are weighted against alternatives, a
                 task that requires simultaneously considering MPI from
                 the viewpoint of both the user and the implementor. The
                 usability of the interfaces for expressing advanced
                 recovery techniques is then discussed, including the
                 difficult issue of enabling separate software layers to
                 coordinate their recovery.",
